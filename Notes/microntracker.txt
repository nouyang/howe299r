*** Error #1

Generally, the numbers after the .so are version numbers, and you'll often find that they are symlinks to each other, so if you have version 1.1 of libfoo.so, you'll have a real file libfoo.so.1.0, and symlinks foo.so and foo.so.1 pointing to the libfoo.so.1.0. And if you install version 1.1 without removing the other one, you'll have a libfoo.so.1.1, and libfoo.so.1 and libfoo.so will now point to the new one, but any code that requires that exact version can use the libfoo.so.1.0 file. Code that just relies on the version 1 API, but doesn't care if it's 1.0 or 1.1 will specify libfoo.so.1. As orip pointed out in the comments, this is explained well at http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Program-Library-HOWTO/shared-libraries.html.

Plus toolkit:
take your image-guidance system from bench to bedside

Free, open-source library and applications for data acquisition, pre-processing,
calibration, and real-time streaming of imaging, position tracking, and other
sensor data.

 Plus was originally developed for ultrasound-guided interventions (hence the
name, Plus - Public software Library for UltraSound imaging research) and it
contains all essential functions for implementing tracked ultrasound systems,
but it is now widely used in all kind of interventions, with and without
ultrasound imaging.
