ROS and apriltag2


Okayyy let's just calibrate the openCV setup. Although stereo seems a little more stable?

I guess I could just write down the stereo readings... eh... or see how to spit it out?
Would have physical moutning issues, though could just place on stool.

 The  ground truth was measured using a laser tape measure

 With  decimation  by  a  factor  of  2,  the  new  detector  only
 takes  0.072  microseconds  per  pixel,  or  about  22  ms  for
 a  640  x  480  image.  The  detector  performance  is  good
 enough  to  run  on  the  relatively  lower-powered  iPhone  and
 similar smartphone processors, opening up new possibilities
 in embedding AprilTags into small-scale applications
