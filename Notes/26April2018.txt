SPI:
Needs 2 analog pins, per "bus".
On each bus, need a unique address per sensor.
Some IC's you can set the address (requires an additional pin on your micro), some you can't.

e.g. If the  datasheet for (another Ic) says 1001xxx -> this allows for 8 different addresses, if you dedicate 3 digital i/o
pins.


However, BMP280 only supports 1bit of change...
https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/BST-BMP280-DS001-11.pdf
The  7 - bit  device  address  is  111011 x .  The  6  MSB  bits are fixed .  The last bit  is  changeable  by SDO value  and  can  be  changed  during  operation .  Connecting SDO  to  GND  results  in  slave address 1110110 (0x76) ; connection it to V DDIO re sults in slave address 1110111 (0x77) , which is  the same as  BMP180 ’s I²C address .  The SDO pin  cannot  be  left  floating; if  left  floating,  the I²C address will be undefined. 

(Note: BMP180 is previous version of this sensor).


This would only allow two i2c addresses! The arduino breaks out 4 or 5 analog pins. We'd only be
able to support 4 devices!


Also, compare to MPL115A2 datasheet, which has a fixed 7bit I2C address, as mentioned on the first page:
0x60. No options there!o

The article mentions "PCF8574 I/O expander ", which would allow you control 

PCF8547Ns
LHLL A2 A1 A0
aka
0100xxx 7 bit I2C address. Already, we can see this can't be used to read from any BMP280 addresses.
(111011x).

Thus, we cannot use the I/O expander. It is cool though!! This shows controlling 24 LEDs using just
two analog pins on the arduino!

There *is* the question of whether the BMP280 would be suitable (e.g. if the diaphragm is directly
under the sensor). If not, apparently the sensor is less sensitive.


https://softroboticstoolkit.com/book/takktile-sensors
. The diaphragm is cast under rubber, and vacuum degassed to bring rubber against the diaphragm.
This greatly improves consistency and sensitivity.

Fortunately, the BMP280 can use SPI. 

http://tronixstuff.com/2011/06/15/tutorial-arduino-and-the-spi-bus-part-ii/

However, must have a digital I/O per chip.
+SCK
+MOSI
+MISO

20 GPIO on arduino uno, -2 for tx/rx,  = about 18 io. With 3 for the SPI comms, that means I can
control about 15 i2c.

Eh, 3x4 array should be enough. Finger is only what, 1cm wide x 2.5 cm long, 

That's a sensor every 250mm/4 = 6.25mm, which we could decrease by doing some staggering / flipping
of the sensors.


And... a lot more if i actually got clever and used other chips.   I have no deep desire to make an
8x5 array... 3x4 is good enough for me. Maybe a contractor can make the 40 sensor array after I
build a prelim 12 sensor array.


    "oh no, top-ish hit on google images for reference imgae, has typo: PB6 should be PB5"


TODO: how does this impact the maximum frequency at which we can read the array of sensors?
Oh well, if we need faster data rates, the next person can design another sensor... open source
hardware, maybe someone can fix it :)

What... that's more than the cost of a breakout...
Breakout ~$10 for 5, even from china... $8.66
(I really hate that nowadays sellers have found a way around sorting for lowest price, by adding in
a "99c" item in the "qty" box).

Hmm. It's so late, I'll order out an Adafruit BM280 breaktout too, just in case.

https://www.adafruit.com/product/2651 $10, or $11.8 with amazon prime. (uhmm.... that must be amazon playing with the prices again :/)o
$4.55 shipping on adafruit.com....

When talking about pressure, atmospheric pressure and barometric pressure are two terms which are
used often. They essentially refer to the same thing, but depending on the usage they may have two
distinct connotations. The main difference between barometric pressure and atmospheric pressure is
that atmospheric pressure describes the pressure exerted by the atmosphere, whereas barometric
pressure refers to a pressure measured by a barometer.

Okay: outstanding questions: is the bmp280 going to respond happily after i stick it under rubber.
To be found out on Saturday..
