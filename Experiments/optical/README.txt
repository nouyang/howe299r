Plus toolkit:
take your image-guidance system from bench to bedside

Free, open-source library and applications for data acquisition, pre-processing,
calibration, and real-time streaming of imaging, position tracking, and other
sensor data.

 Plus was originally developed for ultrasound-guided interventions (hence the
name, Plus - Public software Library for UltraSound imaging research) and it
contains all essential functions for implementing tracked ultrasound systems,
but it is now widely used in all kind of interventions, with and without
ultrasound imaging.
